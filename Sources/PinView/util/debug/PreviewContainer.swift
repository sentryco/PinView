/**
 * Used to preview "light-mode" and "dark-mode" simultaniously
 * - Description: A container view that allows the simultaneous
 *                preview of content in both light and dark
 *                modes for SwiftUI views. This is particularly
 *                useful for designers and developers to visualize
 *                how UI components will look in different color
 *                schemes during the development phase.
 * - Note: We might also test multiple devices at the same time:
 *         https://www.hackingwithswift.com/quick-start/swiftui/how-to-preview-your-layout-in-different-devices
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è This is used by alot of code. Careful when tweaking things
 * - Example: To use `PreviewContainer` to preview a `Text` view in both light and dark modes, you can write:
 *   ```swift
 *   PreviewContainer {
 *       Text("Hello, World!")
 *   }
 *   ```
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Rename to something better like? or keep as is?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add support for both VStack and HStack, toggle it with a bool in init? or a generic bool?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Move dark to top and light to bottom? or keep as is?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Split into multiple files?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Potentially make it opensource? üëà
