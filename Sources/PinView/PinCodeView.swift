import SwiftUI
/**
 * Editable pincode view (used for login)
 * - Abstract: has `title`, `description`, `Mutiple digits`, `verify-btn`
 * - Description: The `PinCodeView` is a user interface component that allows users to input a secure pin code. Each digit of the pin code is entered into its own field, enhancing security by obscuring the input and providing a clear visual cue for the number of digits required. The view supports backspace functionality, enabling users to correct errors by deleting the most recent entry and automatically shifting focus to the previous field. Additionally, the view includes an obfuscation feature that hides the entered numbers, preventing onlookers from discerning the pin code.
 * - Important: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Focus state doesn't work in preview, it works in a real app or simulator
 * - Premiss 1: "Each field will not accept more than one value"
 * - Premiss 2: "On value, the input should change focus to the next one"
 * - Note: Has support for 4 - 6  digit input etc (dynamic number)
 * - Note: Now in this file, we combined what we have been building with a couple of new things. These new things include FocusState FocusState is helping us keep an eye on the inputField the user is currently typing on and notifies us when the input is up to the textlimit
 * - Note: We have specified in our case when the input receives a value that is equal to one, it will notify our FocusState and then the focus will be changed to the next input till we get to the last inputField
 * - Note: Suggestions on how to fix set focus on init: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68073919/swiftui-focusstate-how-to-give-it-initial-value
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Add backlash functionality (requires some exploration) üëâ Make it so that when we tap back-button we delete current then focus moves to prev pin-view, or is this in now?
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Make it so that we can hide numbers we type so others can't see them, obfuscation feature
 * - Fixme: ‚ö†Ô∏èÔ∏è Move to own package. possibly opensource
